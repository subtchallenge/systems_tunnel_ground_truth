# README #

This repo provides ground truth data for Artifact types and locations used at the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Tunnel Circuit.

### Files ###

* Tunnel_Artifact_Ground_Truth.xlsx -- Spreadsheet listing each Artifact; its type; and x,y,z location in the relevant DARPA coordinate frame for each course (Experimental / Safety Research) and configuration (A / B).

* Tunnel_Artifact_Map.pdf -- Pdf format map showing approximate Artifact locations within each course.
    * Notes: 
        * Numbers next to yellow star icons on the map correspond to "Location #" in the Tunnel_Artifact_Ground_Truth.xlsx file.  
        * Map geometry, blockages, and relative dimensions are approximate.
        * Tunnel blockages and other course configurations are notionally represented in this map and are not necessarily indicative of the actual configuration.

* Tunnel_Fiducials_Ground_Truth.xlsx -- Spreadsheet listing reference frame fiducials for each course and a transformation matrix for each that approximately aligns the DARPA frame with UTM.
